Until modern times, cryptography referred almost exclusively to
encryption, which is the process of converting ordinary information
(called plaintext) into unintelligible text (called ciphertext).[10]
Decryption is the reverse, in other words, moving from the
unintelligible ciphertext back to plaintext. A cipher (or cypher) is a
pair of algorithms that create the encryption and the reversing
decryption. The detailed operation of a cipher is controlled both by
the algorithm and in each instance by a "key". The key is a secret
(ideally known only to the communicants), usually a short string of
characters, which is needed to decrypt the ciphertext. Formally, a
"cryptosystem" is the ordered list of elements of finite possible
plaintexts, finite possible cyphertexts, finite possible keys, and the
encryption and decryption algorithms which correspond to each
key. Keys are important both formally and in actual practice, as
ciphers without variable keys can be trivially broken with only the
knowledge of the cipher used and are therefore useless (or even
counter-productive) for most purposes. Historically, ciphers were
often used directly for encryption or decryption without additional
procedures such as authentication or integrity checks. There are two
kinds of cryptosystems: symmetric and asymmetric. In symmetric systems
the same key (the secret key) is used to encrypt and decrypt a
message. Data manipulation in symmetric systems is faster than
asymmetric systems as they generally use shorter key
lengths. Asymmetric systems use a public key to encrypt a message and
a private key to decrypt it. Use of asymmetric systems enhances the
security of communication.[11] Examples of asymmetric systems include
RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman), and ECC (Elliptic Curve
Cryptography). Symmetric models include the commonly used AES
(Advanced Encryption Standard) which replaced the older DES (Data
Encryption Standard).[12]
